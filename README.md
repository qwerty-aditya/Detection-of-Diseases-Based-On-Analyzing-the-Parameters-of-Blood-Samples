# Detection-of-Diseases-Based-On-Analyzing-the-Parameters-of-Blood-Samples
Disease detection is directly correlated to WBC count therefore creating a model that can classify sub-types of WBCs: Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Eosinophil using cell images with high accuracy can help.
We used Transfer learning and were able to classify different WBC types with an accuracy of 85%.
